# code_louisville_project


This is my Code Louisville project. It's nothing special, but I've learned an incredible amount in this short span of time.

It is a basic portfoli/blog concept, and there are a few javascript functionalities. See the nav menu at the top right of the screen thatt was built with jquery. There is a lightbox, for the pictures. There is a rotating image infinite loop of my pictures created with javascript. There is also a parallex background image at the top that was created with jquery.

Thanks for taking a look! I look forward to building on this knowledge for the future!
